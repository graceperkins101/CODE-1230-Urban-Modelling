                <h2>How research meets the definition</h2>
                <p> The land was going into urban decay and people though it was a waste of space because no one was using it. The people and the government wanted to transform it because they thought it was a prime location from the sydney harbour side view. South Brangaroo was originally a container wharf and is being transformed into a new waterfront financial district with a mix of office space, residential buildings, shopping, dining, hotel, hospitality and public spaces which enhances. It will become home to around 1,800 residents and 23,000 office workers and, with more than 50% of the precinct open public space and 100% of the foreshore to be fully accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, it is expected to attract some 18 million visits per year. </p>

            <h3>The Red Square:</h3>
            <p> Consists of bright red, orange and pink concrete floor. Used mainly for sport as the strip has basketball rings and is not car accessible. </p>

            <h3>The Black Market:</h3>
            <p> An area visually identifiable by the strips of white lines on the concrete strip. THis is a more relaxed area filled with a large fountain and a series of benches. It is an area where people can gather to have a bbq, play chess or meet up. </p>

            <p> Housing buildings are found along the strip where Superkilen is located, which can make these areas, along with their colours look separate. But like much of the inhabitants in the area, they are connected all together because they are physically in that 1km strip that is designed for only bicycles to enter. </p>

            <h3>Urban Transformation Approach:</h3>
            <p> Seen as an "extreme form of public participation" as the design was dependent on the idea that its inhabitants would be open to participate in using the park. The notion that the community would participate in these 3 spaces and socially integrate and build stronger relationships in the community. During the building of Superkilen the designers "reached out to the local population inviting them to propose urban elements from their other home countries. By transformating public process into a pro-active proposition they created a park for the people by the people with peer-to-peer design" (http://revolve.media/superkilen-implementing-urban-diversity/). </p>

                <p> This area is highly capitalised, targeted at high end consumers as the hotel will offer rooms to penthouse. </p>
